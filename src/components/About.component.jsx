            Outside of work I'm a husband, a father, a son and a friend. I try
            to enjoy my time with my family as much as I can because life is too
            short not to... if you want to know more about me buy me a beer and
            I'll tell you everything... just kidding you can{" "}
            <Link href="#">get in touch here</Link> but a beer would still be
            nice. ðŸ˜œ
